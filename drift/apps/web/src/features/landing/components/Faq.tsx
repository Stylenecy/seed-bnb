const QA = [
  {
    q: "Is this live trading with real money?",
    a: "No. DRIFT runs on BNB Smart Chain Testnet and an exchange testnet, so no real money moves. We make no profit claims; backtests are research.",
  },
  {
    q: "What exactly does the contract do?",
    a: "It stores two public rules: the current market mood and a 20% loss limit. Before a trade the bot asks it yes or no, and after a trade the bot records the decision. If a recorded loss reaches 20%, the contract halts the bot and only exits are allowed.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if the blockchain can't be reached?",
    a: "The bot can't ask the contract, so it falls back to its own built-in 20% stop and keeps going. That is a weaker guarantee, which is why a fail-closed mode (no answer, no trade) is next on the roadmap.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can the bot's owner bend the rules?",
    a: "Two trust points remain, and we name them: the bot reports its own loss, and its key can lift a halt. Both actions are public and permanent on BNB Chain. Next: losses confirmed by the exchange, and lifting a halt only through a multisig or a time delay.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does the AI place trades?",
    a: "No. The strategies and the risk check are fixed rules. The AI analyst only explains what the system sees, in plain words.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I check all this myself?",
    a: "Open the live guard page: it reads the contract from your browser, with no login or wallet. From there you can open every receipt on BscScan, read the verified source on Sourcify, or ask the contract a what-if.",
